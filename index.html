		<h1> My First Competitive Pokémon Team! </h1>
	</div>

	<div class="introduction">
		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p class="intropar">This is a page about my Pokémon team! I love these games a ton, and I have recently become interested in competitive battling. 
		I am part of a discord server that is hosting a tournament this weekend and I thought I would make a very brief page about it!
	I play the generation 7 games, Sun, Moon, and Ultra Sun and Moon. General info about my team is found below! Follow this link to learn more: <a href="https://pokepast.es/882dcfb4e400bf4f">Click Here</a> </p>

			<h3> Landorus! </h3>
			<p class='pokedescriptions'>Landorus is an incredibly defensive utility pokemon. Every time he is sent in, he lowers the opposing
			pokemon's attack stat. He can set up entry hazards for the other side, and switch out easily with one of his moves, U-Turn. He is
		crucial to putting pressure on strong pokemon and reducing switches.</p>
